abstract: >-
  Research on context compression failure modes in large language models.
  Introduces the validity mirage — where compression preserves surface-level
  correctness while silently substituting the governing hypothesis. Develops
  a tropical semiring algebra for measuring context health and deploys it as
  a production MCP server for Claude Code agentic sessions.
