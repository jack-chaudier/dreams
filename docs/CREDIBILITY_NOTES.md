# Credibility Notes

This file exists to keep interpretation conservative and trustworthy.

## What this repo claims

- Structural failure mode: naive context compression can preserve answerability while losing pivot integrity.
- Guarded retention policies can preserve pivot-critical structure in tested replay fixtures.

## What this repo does not claim

- Universal model-agnostic guarantees.
- Production-readiness of every research component.
- Broad external validity from small real-incident samples.

## Evidence profile

- Strongest evidence: deterministic replay artifacts and canonical MCP validation outputs in `results/`.
- Broader claims: supported by working-paper drafts in `papers/sources/`, with explicit caveats and denominators.

## Privacy boundary

- `dreams` is the public showcase.
- The larger `mirage` monorepo remains private and is not required to consume this repository.
