# Tests Surface

`dreams` is primarily a curated artifact and site repo.

Canonical implementation tests live in `tropical-mcp`:

- `uv run --extra dev pytest -q`
- `uv run tropical-mcp-full-validate`

This folder is reserved for lightweight public-surface checks (for example, artifact consistency and site-data integrity).
