# MCP Source of Truth

The canonical MCP implementation for this research line lives in:

- <https://github.com/jack-chaudier/tropical-mcp>

This repository (`dreams`) is the public research showcase layer:

- interactive demo (`site/`)
- working paper bundle (`papers/`)
- reproducible artifact snapshots (`results/`)

No MCP source is duplicated here to prevent implementation drift.
